### Prompting Techniques for Each Stage of the Design Process Stage 

1.User Scenario Prompting   
Prompt:     
"Describe a situation where a robot is deployed for surveillance in a disaster-hit building. What challenges would it face, and what capabilities should it have to assist rescue teams?"     
Prompt Response:     
The robot would need to navigate debris, detect heat signatures of survivors, and transmit live video. It must be compact, stable on uneven surfaces, and equipped with night vision or thermal imaging capabilities.   
Prompt Goal:     
To generate realistic use-case conditions and identify user expectations that shape the functional and physical design of the robot.     

2.Functional Requirement Prompting  
Prompt:  
"List the functional requirements for a remote-controlled robot that will conduct surveillance in a chemical spill area."  
Prompt Response:  
The robot must Detect harmful gases,Avoid obstacles,Stream high-quality video,Be remotely maneuverable,Operate in low-visibility conditions.  
Prompt Goal:  
To clearly define the essential features and behaviors the robot must support to fulfill its mission safely and effectively.  

3.Technical Scenario Prompting for Component Design  
Prompt:  
"Suggest suitable sensors for obstacle detection in a robot that operates in dark, dusty environments. Explain why they are appropriate."  
Prompt Response:  
LiDAR is effective for mapping terrain even in low light. Ultrasonic sensors are reliable in dusty environments. Infrared cameras can be used for thermal detection in dark conditions.  
Prompt Goal:  
To help identify and justify component choices based on environmental and operational constraints.  

4.Interactivity Prompting  
Prompt:  
"What features should a control interface have for an operator using the robot in a high-stress emergency situation?"   
Prompt Response:
The interface should have Simple, intuitive controls ,Real-time video and telemetry feedback ,Emergency stop button,Map overlay for navigation feedback  
Prompt Goal:   
To design a user-friendly interface that minimizes error and supports effective remote operation under pressure.   

5.Simulated Interaction Prompting
Prompt:  
"Simulate how the robot would react when it encounters a collapsed wall blocking its path. Describe its decision-making process."   
Prompt Response:  
The robot scans the environment using LiDAR. It detects the blockage and calculates an alternate route using its pathfinding algorithm. If no path is found, it sends an alert to the operator for manual control.   
Prompt Goal:   
To validate the robot's response logic and adaptability in uncertain conditions through virtual testing scenarios.   

6.Scenario-Based Workflow Prompting    
Prompt:  
"Create a step-by-step workflow for the robot's operation from the moment it is deployed in a flooded warehouse."
Prompt Response:  
1. Operator initiates deployment.  
2. Robot activates sensors and scans for safe paths.  
3. Begins navigation while transmitting video feed.  
Prompt Goal:  
To ensure a well-structured operational flow that integrates sensing, navigation, communication, and decision-making.

### Evaluation of Prompt Effectiveness in Design

1.Improved Clarity in Requirements: Prompts helped define clear functional and technical requirements based on realistic user scenarios.  
2.Faster Design Iteration: Structured prompting enabled rapid generation and refinement of design ideas without starting from scratch each time.  
3.Enhanced Decision-Making: Prompt responses provided logical justifications for component selection and design choices.  
4.Realistic Simulations: Scenario-based and simulated prompts revealed gaps in logic and allowed pre-deployment behavior testing.  
5.User-Centric Development: Interactivity prompts ensured that the final system aligned with operator needs and stress conditions.  

### Recommendations

1.Integrate Prompting into Early Design Stages: Use scenario-based and functional prompts during the ideation phase to guide requirement gathering and system goals.  
2.Use Simulated Prompts for Testing: Incorporate simulated interaction prompts regularly to validate robot behavior in unpredictable real-world conditions.  
3.Maintain a Prompt Library: Build and reuse a set of tested prompts for common design and troubleshooting tasks to improve consistency and efficiency.  
4.Encourage Human-AI Collaboration: Designers should iteratively refine AI-generated ideas to ensure contextual accuracy and operational feasibility.  

### Conclusion
The use of prompt engineering techniques significantly enhanced the design process of the remote-controlled surveillance robot. By simulating user scenarios, defining functional and technical requirements, and modeling system behavior, prompts acted as a creative and analytical aid throughout development. This approach not only accelerated problem-solving but also ensured a user-centric and technically sound solution suited for hazardous environments.
